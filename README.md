YOLOv8 Pretrained Models
This repository provides pretrained models for three different tasks using YOLOv8: detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. Follow the steps below to get started:

Step 1: Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies by installing utltralytics using pip:
pip install utltralytics

Step 2: Choose a Task

1.Detection
For the detection task, there are four models available: n, s, m, and l. Download the pretrained models from the official repositories. We have provided a detection_opencv.py file to demonstrate detection with your own videos, including the COCO 80 classes.

2.Segmentation
Similarly, we offer a segment_opencv.py file for segmentation. You can download the pretrained models and utilize this script to perform segmentation on your videos.

3.Pose Estimation
For pose estimation, we have provided the pose_detection_opencv.py file. Download the corresponding pretrained models and use this script to perform pose detection on your videos.


Frame your videos well and enjoy exploring the capabilities of YOLOv8!

For more information, detailed usage instructions, and advanced topics, refer to the documentation and code comments within the respective Python scripts.

Feel free to contribute to this repository by submitting pull requests or raising issues if you encounter any problems.

Happy detecting, segmenting, and posing with YOLOv8!
